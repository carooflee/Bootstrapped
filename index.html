        <h3>Pride in the Path</h3>
        <p>It's not particularly easy to be a trans woman in America, to put it mildly. But through community and self-work, I and my sisters have learned to value the things that make us different, and to exude pride in that which others have to told us to be ashamed.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Perseverance</h3>
        <p>Nothing is an over-night process. Success is not a matter of innate talent, it's built from the lessons that come when you fail and the decision to never let those failures mitigate your future successes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Forever Forward</h3>
        <p>Hope is necessary, as necessary as failure. If everything in the world around you is going wrong, you have nothing to keep pushing you if you don't have hope. Some kind of belief that there is something better around the corner, even if you can't see it. </p>
