            <h3>Pride in the Path</h3>
            <p>"Trans in Texas."<br> <br>This has been an easy shorthand to describe the struggles of being transgender in a country that violently opposes you. But it speaks to a truth about experiencing great hatred for who you are, and turning it into a point of pride and love for self. Turning the venom they spit into an antidote for the daily poisons.</p>

            <h3>Perseverance</h3>
            <p>"If you can survive this, you can survive anything." <br><br>These are words I only recently began to believe. It's easy to forget, in the midst of persistent trauma, that you are ending every day alive. That despite all the losses you've faced that day, you still won the biggest fight, even if only in the background. And each day your wake up is another chance to make something better than the day before.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Forever Forward</h3>
            <p>"One day..." <br><br>I don't know where I would be without hope. Not the prettiest hope--broken and taped together, but so deeply held, that even in the wells of despair you know in your bones something has to get better. This is what has kept me alive, and this is what pushes me to keep living. Not just for my own future, but the future of the loved ones I have yet to meet.</p>
